## Made a gacp function in bash alias, Windows 

- `gac (){`

    `echo + git add .`
    
    `git add .`
    
    `echo + git commit -m \'$@\'`
    
    `git commit -m "$*" # gac life is amazing adders`

`}`

# Usage: gacp life is super amazing. 
- `gacps shortcuts life to project pushing quicker.`

gacp (){

    echo + git add .
    
    git add .

    echo + git commit -m \'$@\'
    
    git commit -m "$*"

    echo + git push -f
    
    git push -f

}
